# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains Java code examples for several popular design patterns. Each design pattern is implemented in its own subdirectory, and this README provides a brief overview of each pattern.

## Design Patterns Included

1. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Description: The Adapter Pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It wraps an interface around an existing class to make it compatible with another class.

2. **Builder Pattern**
   - Description: The Builder Pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

3. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - Description: The Chain of Responsibility Pattern lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

4. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - Description: The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

5. **Flyweight Pattern**
   - Description: The Flyweight Pattern minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects, often representing a large number of objects.

6. **Observer Pattern**
   - Description: The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

7. **Proxy Pattern**
   - Description: The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It can be useful for lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

8. **Visitor Pattern**
   - Description: The Visitor Pattern represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. It lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements.
